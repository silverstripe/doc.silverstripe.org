# Using Composer

Composer is the recommended way to install and manage Silverstripe.

## What is Composer?

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on.

## Installing Composer

Visit [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org) for installation instructions.

## Creating a New Project

```bash
composer create-project silverstripe/recipe-cms my-project
```

This will create a new Silverstripe project in the `my-project` directory.
